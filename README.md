# CPP_WS22
Learning C++ â€“ Over the semester, we work on following tasks;


0) Write a program that determines the sizes of all integral types, find at least one alternative way

1) Write a function that takes two initial numbers n1 and n2 and a counter c and returns the c-th "fibonacci" number based on the two initial numbers
1.1) Let that function write a file with the entered input
1.2) it should work for all nummerical types

2) Write a program that determines whether a person is from Berlin or not
2.1) Let that program ask to enter another zip code
2.2) After that it should ask the user something like Enter another person? [y/n];
if y is entered it should repeat the last step; 
2.3) if n is entered it should print the percentage of entered people that lives in Berlin and
the name of the person with the smallest postal code; and then quit

3) Write a program that reads a string from the user input and then a number
3.1) print the i-th character of the string to the user (where i is the number supplied by
the user)

4) Adapt the code from the "Simple I/O" page
4.1) For a single user-given double, have your program print the number rounded down,
rounded up and it's square root; what is the behaviour for negative numbers?
4.2) Find out how to change the precision of the output stream so more/less digits are
printed.
4.3) Find out how to change the output format to always show 1e-02 instead of 0.01.
